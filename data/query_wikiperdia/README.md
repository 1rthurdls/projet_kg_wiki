Here we focussed on another way of retrieveing the data given by our teacher. We use the Wikipedia query service to extract the data. 
We retrieve it by calling the api endpoint of SPARQsql and directly putting the data in a csv format. This is done in the retrieve.py file.

To run the extraction of the data on a basis of a query you need to run
```bash
python retrieve.py
```
This code retrieves 5K examples of articles authors
